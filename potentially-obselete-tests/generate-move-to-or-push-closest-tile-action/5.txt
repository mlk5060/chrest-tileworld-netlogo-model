;Tests that the 'generate-move-to-or-push-closest-tile-action' procedure specifies the correct action pattern when there are
;multiple tiles that are equi-distant close to the calling turtle (adjacent) but none can not be pushed.  However, there is
;one free patch to the west that the calling turtle can attempt to in order to try and push one of these tiles from another heading.
