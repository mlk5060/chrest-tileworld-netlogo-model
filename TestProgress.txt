reinforce-productions?

1. Try to fixate
   - CHREST turtle will be learning visual-information from fixations
   - When finished, the CHREST turtle will be primed to clear its episodic memory.

2. Try to generate plan (add items to episodic memory)
   - Can only do this when attention is free, i.e. when fixation set has completed
   - If the CHREST turtle is primed to clear its episodic memory, it will now and will
     reset the variable that controls this so that it doesn't happen until a new plan
     should be generated.

3. Try to execute plan (execute actions in episodic memory)
