;Given the following situation:
;
; - The calling turtle attempts to move 2 patches along each heading in the global 'movement-heading' list.
; - A hidden turtle is on the patch immediately adjacent to a turtle along the heading specified.
; - A visible tile is on the patch that is two patches ahead of the turtle along the heading specified.
;
;This tests that the following conditions are true:
;
; - For each heading, the 'move' procedure reports boolean 'false' indicating that the move was unsuccessful (the full move process is
;   blocked by the visible turtle).
; - The calling turtle is located on the patch that it was initially on after the 'move' procedure is called.
