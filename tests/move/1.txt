;Given the following situation:
;
; - The calling turtle attempts to move 1 patch along each heading in the global 'movement-heading' list.
; - A hidden turtle is on the patch immediately adjacent to the calling turtle along the heading specified.
;
;This tests that the following conditions are true:
;
; - For each heading, the 'move' procedure reports boolean 'true' indicating that the move was successful.
; - The calling turtle is now located on the patch that it should have moved to.
