;========== TEST AIM ==========
;==============================
;
; To determine if the "move" procedure operates correctly when a turtle is not obstructed from moving along
; the heading specified.
;
;======================================
;========== TEST DESCRIPTION ==========
;====================================== 
;
; - The calling turtle attempts to move 1 patch along each heading in the global 'movement-heading' list.
; - A hidden turtle is on the patch immediately adjacent to the calling turtle along the heading specified 
;   (ensures that hidden turtles do not obstruct movement since they can exist if a player "finishes" playing
;   in the domain before others).
;
;=====================================
;========== TESTS PERFORMED ==========
;=====================================
;
; - For each heading, the 'move' procedure reports boolean 'true' indicating that the move was successful.
; - The calling turtle is now located on the patch that it should have moved to.
