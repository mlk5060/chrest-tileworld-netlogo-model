;====================
;===== TEST AIM =====
;====================
;
; To determine if the "deliberation" prodcedure produces expected output when:
; 1. The calling turtle is a CHREST turtle.
; 2. The calling turtle can use pattern recognition but is guaranteed to use
;    problem-solving.
; 3. The calling turtle does not have a hypothesis in visual STM.
; 4. The calling turtle has a Fixation in the attempted Fixation
;    data structure found in the jchrest.architecture.Perceiver
;    instance associated with the calling turtle's 
;    jchrest.architecture.Chrest instance. The Fixation may/may not
;    have included a tile.
;
;============================
;===== TEST DESCRIPTION =====
;============================
;
; A CHREST turtle is setup according to the instructions in the previous 
; section.
;                                        
;===========================
;===== EXPECTED OUTPUT =====
;===========================
;
; - The time taken to deliberate should be equal to the value of the 
;   CHREST turtle's 'time-to-retrieve-fixation-from-perceiver' since the 
;   last Fixation performed will be retrieved from visual STM.  Even 
;   though the CHREST turtle will attempt to retrieve the visual STM 
;   hypothesis, this will not incur a time cost since visual STM will
;   be empty.  The 'time-to-retrieve-fixation-from-perceiver' will then 
;   be added to:
;   ~ The CHREST turtle's 'time-to-generate-action-when-no-tile-seen' 
;     variable if a tile's location was not encoded in the visual STM
;     hypothesis.
;   ~ The CHREST turtle's 'time-to-generate-action-when-tile-seen' 
;     variable if a tile's location was encoded in the visual STM
;     hypothesis.
;   
; - The CHREST turtle's 'frequency-of-pattern-recognitions' variable should
;   be equal to 0 whilst its 'frequency-of-problem-solving' variable should
;   be equal to 1.
;
; - The CHREST turtle's 'total-deliberation-time' variable should equal 
;   the time taken to deliberate (see above).
; 
; - The CHREST turtle's episodic memory should contain 1 episode, i.e. the
;   one just added and this should have specific contents.
