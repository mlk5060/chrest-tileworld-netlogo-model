;========== TEST AIM ==========
;==============================
;
; 1) To determine if deliberation produces an expected action when the calling turtle is a CHREST turtle, uses problem solving and is guaranteed to see
;    a tile given the state of the observable environment.
;
;======================================
;========== TEST DESCRIPTION ==========
;======================================
;
; 1) A CHREST turtle is created and its observable environment is populated entirely with tiles.
; 2) The CHREST turtle passes its observable environment as a Scene to the "deliberate" function and stores the result.
;
; The observable environment state of the CHREST turtle is depicted visually below.  Each object is denoted by its "who" number followed by the 
; class of the object in parenthesis.

;=====================================
;========== TESTS PERFORMED ==========
;=====================================
;
; The result of the "deliberation" procedure is checked to see if it is as expected:
; - The first item should be an expected action.  Given that any tile in the environment may be seen and the stochastic nature of CHREST's perceptual
;   mechanisms, a wide range of actions may be produced: a "move" or "push-tile" action with any cardinal compass heading.
; - The second item should be the time taken to deliberate, i.e. the time defined for the CHREST turtle to use problem-solving.
; - The third item should be equal to false, i.e. the turtle used problem-solving to generate the action reported.
