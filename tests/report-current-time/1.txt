;==============================
;========== TEST AIM ==========
;==============================
;
; To ensure the "report-current-time" procedure operates as expected when
; the model is running in a training and non-training context.
;
;======================================
;========== TEST DESCRIPTION ==========
;======================================
;
; - The model's running context is set to training.
; - The model's time is set to a known value.
; - The "report-current-time" procedure is invoked.
; - The model's running context is set to non-training.
; - The model's time is set to a known value.
; - The "report-current-time" procedure is invoked.
;
;=====================================
;========== TESTS PERFORMED ==========
;=====================================
;
; After invoking the "report-current-time" procedure, the value returned
; should be what the model time was just set to.
