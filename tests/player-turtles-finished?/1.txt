;========== TEST AIM ==========
;==============================
;
; To determine if the "player-turtles-finished?" procedure evaluates to true as expected.
;
;======================================
;========== TEST DESCRIPTION ==========
;====================================== 
;
; - One turtle of each breed in the global 'breeds' list are created.
; - All turtles that aren't of the breeds 'tiles' and 'holes' are asked to set their 
;   'hidden' turtle variable to true.
; - The "player-turtles-finished?" procedure is then invoked.
;

;========== TESTS PERFORMED ==========
;=====================================
;
; - The "player-turtles-finished?"" procedure reports boolean true after invocation.
