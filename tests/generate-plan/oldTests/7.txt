;Given the following situation:
;
; - A turtle continues to generate a plan given a scene where a tile is 1 patch north of the calling turtle and a hole is 2 patches north of 
;   the calling turtle.
;
;This test ensures that the following conditions are true:
;
; - The 'generate-plan' turtle variable is set to 'false' since an end plan generation condition has been met (tile and hole should occupy 
;   the same coordinates in the mind's eye eventually).
; - The length of the 'plan' turtle variable is equal to 1 since the configuration of the calling turtle, tile and hole should result 
;   in a 'push-tile' north action being generated that will result in the tile and hole occupying the same mind's eye coordinates.  When a 
;   subsequent call to 'generate-plan' occurs, this should not result in an action being added to 'plan'.
; - The 'time-spent-deliberating-on-plan' turtle variable is set to 0 since an end plan condition has been met and this value will be reset
;   for the next plan generation cycle.
; - The 'deliberation-finished-time' is set to the sum of the current time and the 'time-taken-to-problem-solve' value.  This is because an ;   end plan generation condition has been met, only one 'generate-plan' call has been made that results in deliberation occurring and an 
;   action being produced and the turtle can not take advantage of pattern-recognition? in its deliberation process since it hasn't committed 
;   any patterns to its LTM.
; - The mind's eye of the turtle no longer exists since an end plan generation condition has been met.
; - Following the final 'generate-plan' call that results in an action being added to 'plan', the mind's eye content of the turtle is as 
;   expected (calling turtle is 1 patch north of its initial location and the tile occupies the same coordinates as the hole).
