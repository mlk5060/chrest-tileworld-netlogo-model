;Given the following situation:
;
; - Turtle intially generates a plan given a scene where a tile is north of the calling turtle's current location by 1 patch.
; - Turtle attempts to continue plan generation before instantiation of the mind's eye has finished.
;
;This test ensures that the following conditions are true:
;
; - The 'generate-plan' turtle variable is set to 'true' since no end plan generation conditions have been met.
; - The length of the 'plan' turtle variable is 0 (not interested in what the plan contains, this is validated in other tests).
; - The 'time-spent-deliberating-on-plan' turtle variable is set to 0 since plan deliberation has not yet occurred.
; - The 'deliberation-finished-time' is set to 0 since no end plan generation conditions have been met.
; - The mind's eye of the turtle still exists since no end plan generation conditions have been met.
; - The mind's eye content of the turtle is as expected (no other objects expect calling turtle and tile and tile is north of the calling
;   turtle by 1 patch).
