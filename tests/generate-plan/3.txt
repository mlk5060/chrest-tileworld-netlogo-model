;========== TEST AIM ==========
;==============================
;
; 1) To determine if plan generation correctly ends when a CHREST turtle pushes a tile out of its visual-spatial field.
; 2) To determine if salient variables are altered correctly when plan generation is requested after 1 is true.
; 3) To determine if the main body of "generate-plan" where a plan is generated proceeds correctly (implicitly tested), i.e.
;	 a) Does determination of valid visual-spatial field states operate correctly?
;    b) Are moves that produce invalid visual-spatial field states reversed correctly and removed from a turtle's plan?
;    c) Are moves that produce valid visual-spatial field states added to a turtle's plan and retained?

;======================================
;========== TEST DESCRIPTION ==========
;======================================
; 
; 1) A CHREST turtle repeatedly invokes "generate-plan" when its attention is free and it is located in an environment where plan generation will 
;    only result in the CHREST turtle pushing the tile out of its visual-spatial field.
; 2) After the CHREST turtle has pushed the tile out of its visual-spatial field and when its attention is free, the "generate-plan" procedure
;    is invoked again.
;
;To fully test the "generate-plan" procedure with respect to ending plan generation when a tile has been pushed out of visual-spatial range, four 
;initial states are created with each one only allowing the tile in question to be moved in one cardinal compass direction.  
;
;Due to the mechanism of the "deliberate" procedure that is used when plan generation actually occurs, the CHREST turtle may not always push the 
;pushable tile in its visual-spatial field when it is planning.  Instead, it may move onto squares occupied by other mind's eye objects in which 
;case, the action previously planned will be reversed.  So, to accurately determine how long the CHREST turtle spends on deliberating, it is 
;necessary to determine when it reverses a mind's eye move and when it doesn't.  To explain: when a mind's eye move is reversed, there is no 
;deliberation time cost, only the time taken to "reverse" the previous move in the mind's eye, i.e. the time taken to move the mind's eye objects 
;just moved back to their previous positions.
;
;To determine how long the CHREST turtle spends deliberating, the test code checks whether the CHREST turtle's visual-spatial field state is equal to 
;one of a number of valid states for each compass direction after each call to "generate-plan" in the main test loop.  If the visual-spatial field 
;state is not equal to one of these valid intermediates then the last action performed will be reversed and no deliberation time cost will be
;incurred for this mind's eye move.  So, by multiplying the time taken for the CHREST turtle to problem-solve (no learning can occur in this test
;so deliberation by pattern-recognition is impossible) by the product of counting the total number of non-reversal mind's eye moves performed, the 
;time taken by the CHREST turtle to deliberate can be accurately determined and tested.
;
;Since the CHREST turtle continues to call the "generate-plan" procedure until the tile has been moved out of its visual-spatial field, this means 
;that, if the test runs ad infinitum, there is most likely an error in the "generate-plan" procedure code.  However, this condition will not be 
;picked up by the test code since the non-determinism of the "deliberate" procedure means that it is impossible to enforce a strict boundary on 
;when the test should complete, if at all (the CHREST turtle may repeatedly generate a valid visual spatial state, V, then an invalid state, V', 
;forever).  It is therefore the responsibility of the tester to investigate why an infinite loop occurs when this test is run.  Note that each 
;initial state is repeatedly tested 100 times to ensure that most output variation from the "deliberation" is handled correctly.
;
;If the test starts and ends and the end state of the visual-spatial field is as expected then we can implicitly assume that the main body of
;the "generate-plan" procedure works correctly.  However, since planned moves are determined and applied in the CHREST turtle's visual-spatial 
;field by other procedures that are called by "generate-plan", this test makes no attempt to determine if such procedures operate correctly.
;
;The four initial visual-spatial field states, their valid intermediates and expected end states are depicted visually below.  Note: numbers indicate 
;visual-spatial field coordinates relative to the agent's current location and are referenced in the test code.

;=====================================
;========== TESTS PERFORMED ==========
;=====================================
;
;After every "generate-plan" invocation, the test checks that the CHREST turtle's attention clock is incremented as expected.
;   1) After the first invocation, the attention clock will be set to however long it takes to instantiate the mind's eye given the environment.
;   2) Subsequent invocations will actually cause plan generation to be performed (domain time will always be advanced so that attention is free
;      and therefore, the "generate-plan" procedure will not be blocked) so the attention clock will be set to however long it takes to move
;      a tile in the mind's eye and/or the CHREST turtle's visual-spatial avatar.
;   3) After the final invocation, the attention clock should be set to whatever it was set to the last time "generate-plan" was invoked in 2 since
;      no further mind's eye object manipulation should occur given that an end planning condition should have been detected.
;
;When the tile has been pushed out of the CHREST turtle's visual-spatial field but before a subsequent "generate-plan" call is made, the following
;checks are performed:
;
; - The "generate-plan?" turtle variable is set to 'true' since no end plan generation conditions have been detected yet.
; - The "time-spent-deliberating-on-plan" turtle variable is set to the value expected.
; - The length of the CHREST turtle's "plan" is 2 since the only actions that are valid (and are therefore added to the turtle's plan) are two push
;   tile actions.  Note: the contents of the plan are not of interest here; such testing is performed elsewhere.
; - The "deliberation-finished-time" turtle variable is set to 0 since this is only set when "generate-plan" is called and an end plan generation condition
;   is detected.
; - The final state of the CHREST turtle's visual-spatial field is as expected (see above).
;
;After the tile has been pushed out of the CHREST turtle's visual-spatial field and after a subsequent "generate-plan" call is made, the following
;checks are performed:
;
; - The "generate-plan?" turtle variable is set to 'false' since an end plan condition has been met.
; - The "time-spent-deliberating-on-plan" turtle variable is reset to 0 for the next planning cycle.
; - The length of the CHREST turtle's "plan" is still equal to 2 since no further planning should occur and therefore no further actions planned.
; - The "deliberation-finished-time" turtle variable is set to the current domain time plus the value of the "time-spent-deliberating-on-plan" before it is
;   reset to 0.  This is used to simulate inactivity whilst deliberating in the main CHREST turtle control loop.
; - Since an end planning condition has been detected, the state of the CHREST turtle's visual-spatial field should be as it was before the final 
;   "generate-plan" call was made, i.e. it is equal to the expected end state.
