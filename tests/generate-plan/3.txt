;Given the following situation:
;
; - Turtle intially generates a plan given a scene where a tile is north of the calling turtle's current location by 1 patch.
; - Turtle attempts to continue plan generation after instantiation of the mind's eye has finished.
;
;This test ensures that the following conditions are true:
;
; - The 'generate-plan' turtle variable is set to 'true' since no end plan generation conditions have been met.
; - The length of the 'plan' turtle variable is 1 since since the minds eye has been instantiated when the second 'generate-plan' call 
;   is made and there is information available to plan (not interested in what the plan contains, this is validated in other tests).
; - The 'time-spent-deliberating-on-plan' turtle variable is set to the value of the 'time-taken-to-problem-solve' since plan deliberation 
;   has occurred but the turtle can not take advantage of pattern-recognition? in its deliberation process since it hasn't committed any
;   patterns to its LTM.
; - The 'deliberation-finished-time' is set to 0 since no end plan generation conditions have been met.
; - The mind's eye of the turtle still exists since no end plan generation conditions have been met.
; - The mind's eye content of the turtle is as expected (no other objects expect calling turtle and tile, calling turtle and tile have 
;   moved one patch north of their initial location and tile is north of the calling turtle by 1 patch).
