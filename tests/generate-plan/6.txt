;Given the following situation:
;
; - A turtle continues to generate a plan given a scene where it can only move west from its initial location and then west or east afterwards
;   since there are immoveable tiles blocking the tile to the north and south (turtle is also blocked to the east by immovable tiles from
;   its initial location) forming a channel.
;
;This test ensures that the following conditions are true:
;
; - The 'generate-plan' turtle variable is set to 'false' since an end plan generation condition has been met (turtle can either no longer
;   see itself in its mind's eye or its planned x amount of moves where x = the 'depth-of-search' parameter).
; - The length of the 'plan' turtle variable is equal to the number of 'generate-plan' calls made that result in an action being added
;   to 'plan'.
; - The 'time-spent-deliberating-on-plan' turtle variable is set to 0 since an end plan condition has been met and this value will be reset
;   for the next plan generation cycle.
; - The 'deliberation-finished-time' is set to the sum of the current time and the value of 'time-taken-to-problem-solve' multiplied by the 
;   number of 'generate-plan' calls made that result in an action being added to 'plan'.  This is because an end plan generation condition 
;   has been met, multiple 'generate-plan' calls have been made that result in deliberation occurring and the turtle can not take advantage 
;   of pattern-recognition? in its deliberation process since it hasn't committed any patterns to its LTM.
; - The mind's eye of the turtle no longer exists since an end plan generation condition has been met.
; - Following the final 'generate-plan' call that results in an action being added to 'plan', the mind's eye content of the turtle is as 
;   expected (all tiles present but calling turtle not present).
; - Since the 'depth-of-search' parameter may trigger an end-condition and since the turtle may move east and west repetitively, it is 
;   difficult to predict what the content of the mind's eye will be for the turtle when plan generation ends so this is not checked.
;
; NOTE: The initial 'generate-plan' call simply intantiates the mind's eye of the turtle with visual information.  Consequently, no
;       planning occurs when this call is made, only when subsequent 'generate-plan' calls are made.  This is why the counter that 
;       keeps track of how many times 'generate-plan' has been called is only incremented after the initial 'generate-plan' call.
