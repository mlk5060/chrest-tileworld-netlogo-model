;Given a scene where some patches are empty or are 'blind-spots' and others have one or more objects with spaces between object delimiter 
;(comma) on a coordinate in the scene, this tests to see if the visual pattern reported is as expected (multiple objects on same patch have 
;individual patterns, spaces in multiple object identifiers and all empty/null patches are removed and each visual pattern in the chunk is
; separated by a space).
