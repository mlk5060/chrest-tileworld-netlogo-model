;Given a situation where:
;
; - A turtle calls the 'push-tile' procedure and each value in the global 'movement-headings' variable is passed.
; - There is a tile adjacent to the turtle along the heading specified.
; - There is a non-tile and non-hole adjacent to the tile along the heading specified but is hidden.
;
;This tests to see if the following conditions are true:
; 
; - The 'push-tile' procedure reports boolean 'true' for each heading specified with respect to whether the action was performed 
;   successfully.
; - The 'push-tile' procedure reports boolean 'false' for each heading specified with respect to whether a hole was filled.
; - The calling turtle is located on the patch that is 1 patch along from its original location along the heading specified.
; - The tile that was to be pushed is located 1 patch along from its original location along the heading specified.
