;==============================
;========== TEST AIM ==========
;==============================
; 
; To determine if the "push-tile" procedure generates the expected output if
; a player turtle runs the "push-tile" procedure but no tiles exist in the
; environment.
;
;======================================
;========== TEST DESCRIPTION ==========
;====================================== 
;
; - A player turtle, P, is created.
; - P invokes the "push-tile" procedure and each value in the global 'movement-headings' 
;   variable is passed as input.
;
;=====================================
;========== TESTS PERFORMED ==========
;=====================================
; 
; - The result of the "push-tile" procedure is checked:
;   ~ Boolean false should always be reported with respect to whether the action was 
;     performed successfully.
;   ~ Boolean false should always be reported with respect to whether a hole was
;     filled as a result of the action being performed.
;
; - The calling turtle is located on the patch it was originally placed on.
