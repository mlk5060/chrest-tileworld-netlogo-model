;Given a situation where:
;
; - A turtle calls the 'push-tile' procedure and each value in the global 'movement-headings' variable is passed.
; - There is no tile adjacent to the turtle along the heading specified.
;
;This tests to see if the following conditions are true:
; 
; - The 'push-tile' procedure reports boolean 'false' for each heading specified with respect to whether the action was performed 
;   successfully.
; - The 'push-tile' procedure reports boolean 'false' for each heading specified with respect to whether a hole was filled.
; - The calling turtle is located on the patch it was originally placed on.

<test>
	let initial-patch 0
	create-chrest-turtles 1[ set initial-patch (patch-here) ]

	foreach(movement-headings)[
		ask turtle 0 [ 
			check-equal (push-tile (?)) ( list (false) (false) )
			check-equal (patch-here) (initial-patch)
		]
	]
