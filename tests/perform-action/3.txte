;Given a situation where:
;
; - Calling turtle's breed is 'chrest-turtles'.
; - Every action in global 'possible actions' list is checked and can be performed successfully.
; - Calling turtle can't reinforce problem-solving?.
; - Pattern-recognition not used to create action-pattern.
;
;This tests that the following conditions are true for each action performed: 
;
; - Boolean true is reported by the 'perform-action' procedure after every call.
; - If a 'move-randomly' action is performed then the turtle's 'episodic-memory' variable length should be 0 since 'move-randomly' action
;   patterns should never be added to a turtle's 'episodic-memory' because they should never have a chance of being associated with visual 
;   chunks (don't want to bias a turtle's random movement given stochasticity of Tileworld).
; - If any other action than 'move-randomly' is performed then the length of the calling turtle's episodic memory should increase by 1 
;   every time the 'perform-action' procedure is called. Also, after multiple perfomances of this action, only zero or one action-links 
;   between the visual chunk and the action itself should exist in the turtle's LTM for the visual chunk since the 'problem-solving?' action 
;   can not be associated by the calling turtle.
; - Not interested as to the correctness of a turtle's 'episodic-memory' contents since this is checked in another test.
