;Given a situation where:
;
; - The environment is full of hidden objects.
; - A turtle is created and its initial coordinates are set to a known location.
; - Turtle just created calls the 'place-randomly' procedure until it is not located on the known coordinates specified in the previous step.
;
;This tests to see if:
;
; - The coordinates that the turtle is finally located on are not equal to the known coordinates.
